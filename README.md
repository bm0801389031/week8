## feast of many beast seventh function

Description:

All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

## set alarm eighth function

Description:

Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.

setAlarm(true, true) -> false
setAlarm(false, true) -> false
setAlarm(false, false) -> false
setAlarm(true, false) -> true

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

## can we divide it eleventh function

Description:

Your task is to create functionisDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by each out of two arguments.

A few cases:


(-12, 2, -6)  ->  true
(-12, 2, -5)  ->  false

(45, 1, 6)    ->  false
(45, 5, 15)   ->  true

(4, 1, 4)     ->  true
(15, -5, 3)   ->  true

## sentance smash

Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
